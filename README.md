For running the Group_Chat application it is necessary to use the following commands:-

1.npm install -D nodemon

2.npm install express socket.io moment

The functionality of the Group_Chat is that it facilitates group chat among the players of a specific room which is indeed not visible to the other room players thus ensuring privacy.

Important point to note that the previous chats in that chat room would not be visible to the new player in the room.
